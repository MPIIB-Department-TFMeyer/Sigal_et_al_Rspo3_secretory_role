Fig 1a and S2:
- Microarray data was preprocessed according to Code/Antrum/Preprocess_raw_files.Rmd
- Differential gene expression was calculated according to script Code/Antrum/ExpressionAnalysis.Rmd
- GSEA was run on DGE results using script Code/Antrum/GSEA_Analaysis.Rmd and GSEA plots were generated using Code/Antrum/GSEA_plots.Rmd
- Figures are in Results/ [Antrum_KO_vs_WT_Barker_Antral_SC.pdf, Antrum_KO_vs_WT_Lgr5_SC_Signature_Munoz.pdf,
